# EventsList
This short snippet takes an MSL eventlist widget code, pulls all the information from it and then re-formats it into slightly more helpful HTML and then injects that back into the document in the same place as (overwriting) the original code.

In theory this can be dropped into any page with an MSL eventlist and will do it's thing in the background to give us slightly easier code to work with.
